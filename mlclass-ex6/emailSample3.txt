 Mr./Mrs,

  Sorry to interrupt you. I just want to ask several questions about
  graduate applicatoin.

  1) The recommendation letter is in electronic form. It means regular
  email or the picture scanning version with signature? Do you accept
  paper material recommendation letter?

  2) Could I apply PhD and MMath together, or sperately?

  3) From the website, MMath also get financial aid, should I refer the
  requirement for that when applying, or default?

  4) Is MMath student studying under the guidance of a professor?

  Thanks for your answer very much!

  Best Wishes,
  Jianfei Hu
